## About Ycode

**Ycode is an open source visual website builder and CMS.** It's available as a self-hosted project or as a fully managed [Ycode Cloud](https://www.ycode.com/) service. Either way, you get a powerful visual editor that replaces the frustration of website building with creative flow and full design control. Think of it as an open source alternative to tools like Webflow and Framer — except easier to use and with far more control over your projects.

Ycode is packed with features designed to help you build professional, responsive websites:

- A visual editor with full design control — pixel-perfect layouts without writing code
- A built-in CMS to structure and manage your content, with manual entry or bulk imports
- Forms for contact, newsletter signups, and content filtering — built right in
- SEO tools with optimized controls, fast hosting, and flexible content management
- Interactions and animations — page load, scroll, click, and hover effects to bring pages to life
- Localization to design, build, and manage sites in any language
- Real-time collaboration with instant publishing, roles, and permissions
- A library of ready-to-use, customizable templates

And [Ycode Cloud](https://www.ycode.com/pricing) gives you even more:

- Managed hosting on a scalable cloud platform
- Official support from the Ycode team

**The Ycode ecosystem proudly features:**

- A friendly and helpful [community](https://discord.gg/ycode)
- Extensive [documentation](https://docs.ycode.com/) and an [academy](https://www.ycode.com/academy) to get you building fast
- A modern stack built on Next.js and Supabase

## Setting Up Ycode Open Source

To self-host Ycode, fork the [ycode/ycode](https://github.com/ycode/ycode) repository. You'll need a GitHub, Supabase, and Vercel account to get started. Full instructions are in the repo.
